# Pantry App

This is an app I have created for creating pantries and organizing items within those pantries.

To run this app clone this repository and run `rake db:migrate` in your terminal and then `shotgun` to start the program. Visit the local host URL provided by shotgun to view the app in your browser. You many have to run bundle install to get the program to run.
